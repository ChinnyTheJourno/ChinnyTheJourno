- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChinnyTheJourno
- 👀 I love journalism as it's my major in college right now
- 🌱 I want to learn how to code and I thought this would be the place to do that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner codes, especially for those who have never coded before
- 📫 You can reach me via email: chinyere.ibeh@outlook.com (or just DM me — if that's a thing on here)
